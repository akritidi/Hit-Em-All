Hit 'Em All is a remake of the classic arcade game Whac-A-Mole adapted for Android devices. The player competes against the computer by hitting as many moles as come out
of their holes. As the player's score increases, so does the difficulty of the game. The player starts the game with 3 lives and every time a mole escapes they lose one, 
until they lose all of them. At the end of the game the player has the option to save their score and name, just like in classic arcade games. There are also settings to 
choose to turn music and sound effects on or off. Technologies used: Android, Java, SQLite.
